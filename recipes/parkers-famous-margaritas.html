    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the signature drink at my in-law's home. 
        My father-in-law developed a taste for margaritas 
        made from scratch during the summer they spent in 
        Zihuatanejo during the 1960s. After decades of 
        tinkering he has arrived at this foolproof recipe 
        for the ultimate Mexican cocktail.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 fluid ounces tequila</li>
        <li>3 fluid ounces fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1 fluid ounce sweetended lime juice</li>
        <li>3 fluid ounces triple sec (orange-flavored liqueur)</li>
        <li>ice cubes</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>rimming salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the tequila, lime juice, sweetened lime juice 
            and triple sec into a cocktail shaker and add a generous 
            scoop of ice. Cover and shake until the shaker is frosty, 
            about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Rub a lime wedge around the rim of a margarita glass and 
            dip in salt. Fill each glass with ice. Strain equal amounts 
            of the cocktail into the glasses to serve. Garnish with a 
            lime wedge.</li>
    </ol>
