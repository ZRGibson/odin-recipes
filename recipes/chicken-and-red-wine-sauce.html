    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>2/3 cup red wine or reduced-sodium chicken broth plus
                1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons snipped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons snipped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place each chicken breast half between two pieces of plastic 
                wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, pound chicken lightly 
                to about 1/4 inch thick. Discard plastic wrap. Sprinkle chicken 
                with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In a 12-inch skillet melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high 
                heat. Reduce heat to medium. Add chicken to skillet. Cook chicken for 
                6 to 8 minutes or until no longer pink, turning once. Transfer chicken 
                to a platter; cover with foil to keep warm. Turn off burner or remove 
                skillet from heat.</li>
            <li>Add mushrooms, wine, broth, vinegar and thyme to the hot skillet. Return 
                skillet to heat. Cook and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the 
                bottom of the pan. Bring to boiling. Boil gently, uncovered, about 8 
                minutes or until liquid is slightly thickened and reduced. Reduce heat 
                to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter and parsley, stirring until butter is 
                melted. Serve sauce over chicken.</li>
        </ol>
