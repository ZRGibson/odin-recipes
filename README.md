# odin-recipes
This is a recipe webpage I created to practice using HTML and git version control.

I also used this project to get comfortable only using the command line 
with no GUI to manipulate files and directories.

Each new .html file I added allowed me the opportunity to improve my formatting for better readability.

I do not own any of the images included within this project.
